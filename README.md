### Name: Bikeshare


### This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. In order to do this I have implemented some functions. These functions ask user to specify a city, month, and day to analyze (get_filters), load data for the specified city and filters by month and day if applicable (load_data), display statistics on the most frequent times of travel (time_stats), display statistics on the most popular stations and trip (station_stats), display statistics on the total and average trip duration (trip_duration_stats), display statistics on bikeshare users (user_stats) and ask user how many rows of row data should be displayed (raw_data).
